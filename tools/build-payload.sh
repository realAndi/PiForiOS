# Needs the iPhoneOS SDK, so it has to run on macOS. The result is a ~68 KB
# dylib; the ~75 MB Pi binary is never touched at this stage -- it is not in this
# package at all. build-deb.sh downloads it only to checksum it and confirm it is
# still patchable, and the postinst fetches and patches the real thing on device.
#
# The version argument does not reach the compiler: the shim supplies symbols
# iOS's libSystem lacks and emulates JIT W^X, neither of which depends on which
# Pi is being wrapped. It is recorded so build-deb.sh and the payload cannot
# disagree about what was built. See CONTRACT.md in ios-port-ci.

# thing standing between an unsigned dylib and a package that cannot load on
# anybody's phone: dyld refuses a Mach-O with no cdhash, and nothing before this
# point exits non-zero. check-macho.py rather than `codesign -dv` because it is
# pure stdlib and reads LC_CODE_SIGNATURE directly, so this check survives on a
# laptop, on Linux, and anywhere codesign is absent -- and it also confirms the
# dylib claims iOS and links nothing that iOS lacks.
